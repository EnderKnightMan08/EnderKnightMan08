# Hello fellow Coders!
For introductions, I'm a fellow newbie in coding and perhaps you've found me idling here?
Good for you, I'm worthless and my project were fully volunteer-based either forked from or own.
## I'm here just for fun, if you've travelled this far by coincidence or intend, then I'd suggest checking out other repositories other than mine
*They're better than some weird sh!t I've done*
# Thank you and Goodbye!
